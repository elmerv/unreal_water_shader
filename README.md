# Unreal Water Shader
This is my attempt to make a dynamic water shader on unreal engine 5.

Link to youtube video of first demo (click on image):

## What I plan on working on:

- There is a bug on when you partially view the above plane and under plane. I need to figure out how to render post processing volume in it's area when this happens. 

- I also plan on working on adding depth fog underwater to make underwater more realistic.
